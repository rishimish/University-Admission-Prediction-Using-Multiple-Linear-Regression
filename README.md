# Graduate Admission Prediction Using Multiple linear Regression
In this project I trained the regression models to find the probability of a student getting accepted into a particular university based on their profile.
The data used in following manner
GRE Scores ( out of 340 )
TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 )
University Rating ( out of 5 )
Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength ( out of 5 )
Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 )
Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 )
and finally return the chance of admit (as 0 or 1)
